// Constructor function is an object that has a default prototype object. Creating functions using the prototype will be shared with all objects created with the constructor function.

// First, JS checks the method in that object; if not found, it then checks in the prototype object.
// So, the prototype is an object that inherits the properties and methods from another object.
// It is used for efficient memory management and object inheritance, so instead of duplicating methods for every object instance, we can share methods, and they will be available.

// It does not work with arrow functions because this points to the global object.
