// We use const result = {}; because result is our final object, and we never reassign itâ€”only modify its properties. Using const ensures it stays immutable at the top level. On the other hand, let current = result; is necessary because current acts as a pointer that helps us build the nested object step by step. Since we reassign current inside the loop to move deeper, it must be let, not const."

// âœ… This answer is clear, concise, and demonstrates understanding of variable scoping and object


// "current is a reference to result, so when we update current, it modifies result as well. Since objects in JavaScript are stored by reference, assigning current[key] = {} actually updates result. Then, current = current[key] moves the pointer deeper, ensuring that nested properties are created correctly inside result."
